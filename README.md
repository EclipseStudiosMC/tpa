<h3>In more detail:</h3>
<details>
Doing the /trigger TPA command will give you a list of players to request to tp to one of them. Once you clicked on one of the names the other person will receive a chat message to accept the tp, if they click on it you will be teleported to them. If 30 seconds pass and the other person didn't accepted, the request will be cancelled.

## Settings

This datapack has 2 setting:
- Recommended Gamerule: Disables `sendCommandFeedback` to hide some unnecessary text, but keep in mind that it also hides text from other commands like `/data`.
- Remove the black color: This setting removes the black color from the color pool for when you are selecting who you are going to tp to for better visibility.

All the options can be found when doing `/reload` inside `[Settings]`.

## FAQ

#### Q: Does it have multiplayer compatibility?

A: Yes it does.

#### Q: Does this datapack work on older/newer versions?

A: This datapack doens't work on older versions than 1.20.2, this is due to the use of macros which are exlusive to 1.20.2+. If for whatever reason you want to use it in a newer version and the official update hasn't happened just download the lastest version and change inside the `pack.mcmeta` of the datapack the "[pack_format](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format)" value to the desired one (it may not work or at least not as intended).

#### Q: Can I modify the datapack and redistribute it?

A: Yes you can, but only if you say who the original creator is ([Eclipse Studios](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8)) and if you link the [original Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tpa) somewhere noticeable in the project.

#### Q: Are you guys going to make more datapacks?

A: Yes we will, we already have some pending ideas for our future datapacks so be hyped! For more updates on our future datapacks join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8).

#### Q: Is this datapack compatible with other datapacks?
