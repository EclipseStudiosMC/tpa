# Teletransportation Accept (TPA)

Teletransportation Accept adds the possibility to request to another player to tp to him! This datapacks makes use of the newly added macros in functions in the Minecraft 1.20.2 update!

## __**IMPORTANT READ BEFORE USE**__

The person who run the command needs to be an **Administrator** or have **Cheats Active** or else the datapack won't work. This is required because we use `/function` in order to work and to run them you need to be an **Administrator** or have **Cheats Active** for them to work. And for those who don't know why we need functions to make this happen is because we use macros in this functions, that's the main reason of why this datapack exists in first place.

## Features

- `/trigger TPA` command
- Multiplayer compatibility

<h3>In more detail:</h3>
<details>
Doing the `/trigger TPA` command will give you a list of players to request to tp to one of them. Once you clicked on one of the names the other person will receive a chat message to accept the tp, if they click on it you will be teleported to them. If 30 seconds pass and the other person didn't accepted, the request will be cancelled.

## FAQ

#### Q: Does it have multiplayer compatibility?

A: Yes it does.

#### Q: Why the command doesn't work?

A: Remember to have **Cheats Active** or be and **Administrator** or else when you run the commands they won't work. This is required because we use `/function` in order to work and to run them you need to be an **Administrator** or have **Cheats Active** for them to work. And for those who don't know why we need functions to make this happen is because we use macros in this functions, that's the main reason of why this datapack exists in first place.

#### Q: Does this datapack work on older/newer versions?

A: This datapack doens't work on older versions than 1.20.2, this is due to the use of macros which are exlusive to 1.20.2+. If for whatever reason you want to use it in a newer version and the official update hasn't happened just download the lastest version and change inside the `pack.mcmeta` of the datapack the "[pack_format](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pack_format)" value to the desired one (it may not work or at least not as intended).

#### Q: Can I modify the datapack and redistribute it?

A: Yes you can, but only if you say who the original creator is ([Eclipse Studios](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8)) and if you link the [original Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tpa) somewhere noticeable in the project.

#### Q: Are you guys going to make more datapacks?

A: Yes we will, we already have some pending ideas for our future datapacks so be hyped! For more updates on our future datapacks join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/X2NTE7hkq8).

#### Q: Is this datapack compatible with other datapacks?

A: Yes it is. This datapack follows the [Smithed](https://wiki.smithed.dev/conventions/) conventions to ensure datapack compatibility.

#### Q: Why a lot of unnecessary text appears in chat when I run it?

A: It is very recommended to have the gamerule sendCommandFeedback set to false false. You can manually turn it off by doing `/gamerule sendCommandFeedback false` or by typing `/reload` and clicking on `[APPLY]`.
